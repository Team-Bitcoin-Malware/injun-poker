Ever play that game where you kick a can around on the ground? What if
that can was connected by bluetooth and you could keep track of the score!?

Well injun poker is nothing like that.

In injun poker each player is dealt a card places it on their forhead.
Judging by the other players' cards, each player places a bet on whether
their card is the highest.
